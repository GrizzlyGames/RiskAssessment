    answers:
    - 0-15yrs.
    - 14-35 yrs.
    - 36-60 yrs.
    - 61 plus

    - 'Woman 15-35 at highest risk to become involved in an abusive relationship. '
    - 'Hopefully you''re in a stable loving relationship. No violence by now, not

      time. '
    - Healthy mature adults at low risk of partner abuse.  Watch for health problems,
      dimensia and terminal illness.

    answers:
    - I don't have any kids
    - We have have child(ren)
    - I have child(ren) from a previous relationship

    - 'Lucky you. Children can create stress. Remember to take care of each other
      too. '
    - Lucky you. Remember to look after each other too. Watch for partner being jealous

    questions: Financially, I am ...
    questionNum: 3
    answers:
    - Independent
    - Dependent on him
    - On social assistance
    - He is dependent on me
    implication:
    - Good! Having your own money gives you options.
    - Money is power. You need some of "your" money. You need to know what he is doing
      with his.
    - 'Can be hard, but at least you''re not dependent on him. Being on Social Assistance
      limits your options, especially housing.   '
    - 'Great! Men can find it hard on the ego. Find other ways to let him "be a man". '

    questions: I am seeing?
    questionNum: 4
    answers:
    - Nobody at the moment.
    - One good man is all I need.
    - Exploring my options /  seeing more than one man.
    - I'm seeing 3 or more men at any one time.
    implication:
    - Good for you. If you can be happy with yourself, you will be more selective
      about which man you let into your life.
    - Lucky you. Hopefully the "Creep Meter" will confirm that he is worthy of your
      love and attention.
    - 'It''s time to pick one or neither. Jealous of a rival is the oldest reason
      in the book for a man to abuse a woman. '
    - Men can't share. Jealousy leads to violence. More men, more risk of violence.
      Stop it!

    questions: Your partner's age is
    questionNum: 1
    answers:
    - Within 5 years of my age
    - More than 10 years older
    - More than 10 years younger
    - I don't know
    implication:
    - As it should be. Big gap in age = power differential. Abuse is about power.
    - A big gap in age can be exploited by an abusive partner
    - 'He''ll break you heart when he finds someone closer to his age. Don''t fall
      into the trap of being his lover and his mother. '
    - Some people lie about their age. Find out his true age.

    questionNum: 2
    answers:
    - Has his own place
    - Lives with me
    - In Jail/Prison
    - Shelter/Homeless
    implication:
    - 'As it should be. Make him earn a place. When you''re ready, live at his house
      on a trial basis. It''s easier to leave than kick him out. '
    - 'As it should be - if your married or he''s earned a place in your home. Don''t
      rush in together. Proximity creates more opportunity for things to turn abusive. '
    - ??????????????????????????????????????????????
    - Really? Why are you waisting your time on someone who can't support themself?
      Do you want a partner, or a project?
